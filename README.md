# Sokoban ai

![](figure/sokoban.webp)

This repository is to develop RL algorithms for sokoban env

A-start algorithm is for benchmark and test if the result is possible.


# Things to do:
- [x] get the state of the all the boxes and worker
- [x] get weight euclidian, manhattan, etc
- [ ] write the A star function for baseline measurement
- [x] write DQN algorithm
- [x] write DDQN algorithm
- [ ] write DDPG etc

# dependencies:

- pygame
- gym
